#### Ask the Hummy
1. Types of questions you were asked during the interview
2. What Questions do you wish you weer more prepared for
3. What was something you struggled with during the interview
4. What are 5 ( top of the head "need to know" tools you use everyday )
5. What is the most common thing you do ( behavior wise ) during a work day 
6. what the things you don't like about pentesting ( in work setting: I.e., difficult clients, repetitive report write ups, etc. )

Answers:
1. Explain how you exploit the box & what ( you liked & didn't like about your methodology & end point )
- What is SQLi ( tools, what are they, what they can be used )
- ( paste a string, ,looks base64 and just to be able to tell can you tell ) --> terminals -->> nmap commands
- ( run responder --->> while its running -->> look up the hosts with nmap to see what is live & an open) 
- responder -->> posions ( look it up )

2. Linux ( knowledge ) ( living off the land <<---------- ) 
- utilize what is already avalible on the machine ( ONLY what you have ) 

opsec::
- commands and actions mostly envo safe - no detection - stealthy - tools that have good opsec 
- whoami -- echo %username% -->> avoid detection ( stealth )

Tools: 
- Google Calandar  ( monday - start of week )
- DIscord profecient 
- SSH ( access to internal machines ) 

- burp
- tmux
- vmware ( VMs )  -->> base image ( has all the tools, main image --> snap ) 
 ( each client gets a new image, and clonned from the base image where all the tools are kept ) -->> for confi - destroys image after test

- inpacket TOOLS
- Net

REPORTS:
- sendsafley.com
- tresorit.com
( sending conf data across ) 


( sales / engineer )

- project ( float ) -->> which calander we get tests
- know about 2 weeks prior to the test ( confirm scope, about the test )
- yes/no to the kick-off call ( compliance - don't really care )  60/40 ratio of care
- Whenever the engagement starts ( type of taste matters -->> grey-->> let them know your starting -->> depends: no micro-managing ( if there is a crit -->> let them know right away )


Netex



Difficult: 
- CLients aren't responsive / Difficult avalibity 
 --->>>> imposter sysndrome, keeping irrelvant -->> not doing enough -->> " one flaw to mention " 
Team Connection & Chemistry

!!!!!!!!!!!! THis has to be a hobby !!!!!!!!!!!

Difficult Clients:
 POC ( point-of-contact )
     - Re-take: When you can come back and re-test
     - Dealing with difficult clients
     - CLients aren't responsive / Difficult avalibity

Team Chemistry & Connection:
 - willing to take initiave
 - Great Team Player
 - Lead by example

Operation Security (opsec):
     -->> whoami [x]
     -->> echo %username% (/)

ED:
 - living off the land ( native tools to pentest with --> windows tools )
 - CYA ( Cover Your Ass )
 - Everything should be in writting before executing
 - Measure 3x : Cut 1x

GTK:
 - Always give a 15-30min buffer period after requesting and changes with or too the client
     -->> incase client aggrees & then changes their mind - we have CYA

CYA:
- Give a 30min buffer period to be sure client doesn't change their mind.
- Everything should be done in writting and through email for immutable converstation records.

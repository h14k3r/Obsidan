#### inband
  > Attacker uses the same communication channels to launch the attack & gather the results of the attack
- error -->> force the database to give you an error & resulting in more information about how things operate at the backend.  
- union -->> leverages the "union" opperator to combine the results of two queries into a single results app. Used often for "username" & "password" attacks

  - boolean
  - time
